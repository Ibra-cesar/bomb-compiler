### This compiler is a hobby project of me trying to learn c. 

Using C for a year now it's so fun lol, for some reasong everything make sense heh so after doing
a bunch of project with it ranging from the easy to very complex, now i decided to write a project that
most of people using c would do... Writing a Compiler. It's almost like ==a rite of passage==.

### Goals

Any way the end-goal of this project:
- Deep dive and to explore more about memory management.
- How a program is proccess from source-code to executable.
- TO FLEX... that i'm not just a web/mobile dev lol anymore.

###That's all thank's.
